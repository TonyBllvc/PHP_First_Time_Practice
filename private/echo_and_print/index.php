    <?php 

    // With PHP, there are two basic ways to output data to the screen: echo and print.
    // Both echo and print are used to output data to the screen.

    // The differences are small:
    
    // - echo has no return value, while print has a return value of 1 so it can be used in expressions
    // - echo can take multiple parameters, while print can take one argument
    // - echo is marginally faster than print
