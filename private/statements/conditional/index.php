        // PHP Conditional Statements
        // Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different conditions. You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.
         
        // In PHP we have the following conditional statements:
         
        // if statement - executes some code if one condition is true
        // if...else statement - executes some code if a condition is true and another code if that condition is false
        // if...elseif...else statement - executes different codes for more than two conditions
        // switch statement - selects one of many blocks of code to be executed
