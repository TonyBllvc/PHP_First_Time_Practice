        // Superglobals were introduced in PHP 4.1.0, and are built-in variables that are always available in all scopes.

        // PHP Global Variables - Superglobals
        // Some predefined variables in PHP are "superglobals", which means that they are always accessible, regardless of scope - and you can access them from any function, class or file without having to do anything special.
        
        // The PHP superglobal variables are:
        
        // $GLOBALS
        // $_SERVER
        // $_REQUEST
        // $_POST
        // $_GET
        // $_FILES
        // $_ENV
        // $_COOKIE
        // $_SESSION
