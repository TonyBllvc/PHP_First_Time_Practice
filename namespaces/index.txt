___ PHP Namespaces ___ 

Namespaces are qualifiers that solve two different problems:

    1. They allow for better organization by grouping classes that work together to perform a task
    2. They allow the same name to be used for more than one class

For example, you may have a set of classes which describe an HTML table, such as Table, Row and Cell while also having another set of classes to describe furniture, such as Table, Chair and Bed. Namespaces can be used to organize the classes into two different groups while also preventing the two classes Table and Table from being mixed up.

____ Declaring a Namespace ____
Namespaces are declared at the beginning of a file using the "namespace" keyword:

Syntax
Declare a namespace called Html:

<?php
namespace Html;
?>
Note: A namespace declaration must be the first thing in the PHP file. The following code is invalid:

<?php
    echo "Hello World!";
    namespace Html;
    ...
?>

Note: A namespace declaration must be the first thing in the PHP file. The following code is invalid:

<?php
    echo "Hello World!";
    namespace Html;
    ...
?>

constants, classes and functions declared in this file will belong to the Html namespace:

... continue to the "index.php" file


For further organization, it is possible to have nested namespaces:

Syntax
Declare a namespace called Html inside a namespace called Code:

<?php
namespace Code\Html;
?>
